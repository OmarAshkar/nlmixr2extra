#' Example single dose Theophylline ODE model

#' This is a nlmixr2 model that is pre-run so that it can be used in
#' package testing and development.  It is regenerated whenever
#' binaries of `nlmixr2extra` are created.  If there is a binary
#' incompatability between the fit objects, a simple rerun of the
#' installation will fix this nlmixr2 fit object.
